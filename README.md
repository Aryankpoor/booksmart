# TruePad
A bluetooth camptible macropad which can be used with Lineage OS on raspberry pi. Usable with GApps installed and can be used as a remote.
Works on wired mode or battery mode.

Contains 1 rotary encoder for volume control and pretty much every button in a regular remote control for an android telivision. Contains a power led also.

Still a WIP
